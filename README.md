# Mood UI
**UI Theme for Atom, inspired by Youtube's Darkmode**

## Install
Fire up a console and type:
```bash
apm install mood-ui
```
Or, inside Atom's settings select Install and then search for this package.

## Build it Yourself
To build and test it yourself you need two things installed locally. This repository and [Atom](https://atom.io).
##### Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/arakilian0/mood-ui.git
```
##### Open in Development Mode
When you open Atom like this: `atom .` that opens the Atom editor in a so called "production" environment. Use the following flag to open Atom in a "developement" environment, which offers live reload.
```bash
atom --dev .
```
##### Force Reload
If for some reason you made a change that you know forsure should have rendered a difference, but the change was not rendered, try reloading Atom.
```javascript
// While in the Atom editor trigger the following keyboard shortcut
Ctrl+Command+Alt+L
```
